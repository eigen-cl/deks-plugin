# DEKS Cloud MCP tool map

Remote endpoint: `https://api-deks.eigen.cl/mcp/`

Public clients authenticate through the server's MCP OAuth flow. A direct development/CLI connection may instead send `Authorization: Bearer deks_pat_...`; PATs are workspace-bound, shown once, hashed at rest, revocable, and scoped to `read` and/or `write`. Never embed a PAT in a distributed plugin.

Treat the tools discovered from the server as the current source of truth. Review
their schemas plus `readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`, and `destructiveHint`
annotations before every release; do not rely on a hard-coded tool count.

This is the canonical Core 6 codec v3 surface. It has no version-suffixed or
legacy aliases. `upload_asset` remains image-only; narration audio must already
exist as an embedded admitted asset before `set_slide_narration` can reference it.
Desktop's kebab-case Core commands are not Cloud operations.

## Read tools

- `list_presentations()` — list workspace decks and canonical revisions.
- `get_presentation(presentation_id)` — read the presentation, its ordered slides, element states, motion and current revision.
- `get_slide_state(presentation_id, slide_id)` — read one checkpoint and its typed states.
- `list_assets(limit?, cursor?)` — list workspace-scoped media newest first; `limit` defaults to `50` and accepts `1..100`, while `cursor` is an optional UUID copied verbatim from `next_cursor`. The result contains `items` and `next_cursor`; URLs are authenticated workspace paths and bytes are not embedded. Inspect this before requesting a new attachment, and reuse an existing matching asset instead of uploading a duplicate.
- `get_layout_snapshot(presentation_id, slide_id)` — read absolute rectangles and deterministic geometry estimates. Treat estimated text bounds as conservative pre-render signals, never as browser measurements.
- `render_slide_preview(presentation_id, slide_id, expected_revision, width?)` — render one private checkpoint as a PNG (`width` is `1280` or `1600`) and return `layout_measurements_available`, renderer-derived `layout_measurements`, and `overflow_element_ids`. Always pass the freshly read revision. Use DOM measurements only when the availability flag is exactly `true` and their unique element ID set equals the freshly read slide's rendered element ID set. Missing, duplicate, or unexpected measurement IDs make coverage incomplete. Only complete coverage plus an empty overflow list supports a no-overflow conclusion. A false or absent flag is an image preview without DOM diagnostics, even if `layout_measurements` or `overflow_element_ids` is empty. Map reported overflow IDs back to semantic element names, correct them, re-read, and re-render until a compatible result confirms exact coverage and no overflow. The image is sent to the MCP client/model and is the basis for rendered QA, not a data-isolation mechanism.
- `validate_layout(presentation_id)` — return geometry-only errors and AABB collision/outside-canvas warnings based on authored bounds and estimates. It is not DOM measurement or rendered visual QA and currently has no semantic understanding of containment or z-order intent.
- `list_icon_catalog(family?, query?, limit?, cursor?)` — search the complete official
  Lucide 1.34.0 catalog bundled offline. Filtering happens before pagination;
  `limit` defaults to `50` and accepts `1..100`, and `cursor` is copied verbatim
  from `next_cursor`. Results report the pinned family version, total matches and
  sanitized primitive nodes (`path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polyline`,
  `polygon`, `rect`), never arbitrary markup or remote URLs. Page instead of
  requesting the whole catalog in one response.
- `recommend_palettes(intent, mode?, limit?)` — recommend complete semantic palettes with measured contrast ratios. Apply role colors and their paired `on_colors` together rather than cherry-picking swatches.
- `complete_palette(intent?, mode?, background?, primary?, secondary?, reserve_semantic_colors?)` — preserve a valid supplied subset of `background`, `primary`, and `secondary`, then deterministically complete `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `background`, `text`, and `subtext` from the nearest catalog palette. The result includes `on_colors`, measured `contrast_checks`, `provided_roles`, `source_palette_id`, semantic `success`, `failure`, and `warning` colors, plus guidance. It infers mode from the background or defaults to dark. Its default reserves semantic colors; set `reserve_semantic_colors: false` only for a deliberate system that keeps status understandable another way. If fixed anchors cannot meet the contrast contract, the tool fails instead of silently changing them.
- `export_deck(presentation_id)` — return a portable `.deks` ZIP archive as base64. This MCP response path caps the returned archive at 20 MB; that is a transport guard, not the portable format's 95 MB physical / 90 MB uncompressed bound. A larger valid deck remains exportable through the Web/Cloud file flow. Never paste base64 into chat.

## Asset upload tool

- `upload_asset(file, idempotency_key)` — admit one image explicitly attached by the
  user to the authenticated workspace and return its canonical asset metadata,
  including `id`. Call it only when the current request actually contains
  that attachment. Reuse the returned `id` as the `asset_id` field in every image element that uses
  the same file; do not upload it once per slide. Never invent file bytes, a local
  path, or a URL, and never claim that a path mentioned in chat is an attachment.
  If no file is attached, ask the user to attach it and do not call the tool.

The same Cloud admission contract used by Web applies: PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP up to
50 MB or static safe SVG up to 5 MB, with 16,384 units per side and 40 megapixels
of logical width × height. SVG is canonicalized before hashing and storage.
Cloud's decoder and preview add host-specific animated-raster guards of 200
frames and 100 megapixels in aggregate; those are not portable Web/Desktop
format limits.

## Presentation palette tool

- `set_presentation_palette(presentation_id, primary, secondary, accent, background, text, subtext, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — replace all six default roles as one typed, reversible transaction. First select or complete a palette, review its contrast, then pass every returned role. Creating a presentation does not accept palette input: create it, capture revision `1`, then call this setter with that exact revision.

Inside `apply_commands`, use the operation `{"command":"set_presentation_palette","arguments":{"palette":{"primary":"#...","secondary":"#...","accent":"#...","background":"#...","text":"#...","subtext":"#..."}}}`. The outer batch supplies `expected_revision` and `idempotency_key`. The setter persists presentation defaults; restyle existing explicit slide and element colors separately when the selected system should change an existing deck.

## Slide tools

- `create_presentation(name, motion_beat_ms, expected_revision, idempotency_key, canvas?)` — create a presentation with one blank slide. `canvas` is the canonical `{width,height}` object. Use `expected_revision: 0` when this tool is present in the discovered server contract.
- `delete_presentation(presentation_id, expected_revision, confirmation_name)` — prepare, but do not execute, permanent deletion of one exact presentation. Call only after the user chooses exactly one name and explicitly requests permanent deletion. Re-read that presentation immediately before calling and pass its fresh revision and exact current name. The read-only result reports `confirmationRequired: true` and renders `ui://deks/confirm-presentation-deletion-v2.html`; the presentation must still exist at this point. The signed, expiring confirmation token exists only in result `_meta` for the widget and must never be requested, copied or exposed to the model.
- `confirm_delete_presentation(confirmation_token)` — app-only/private execution tool. It is absent from the model's usable surface even though it is present in raw MCP discovery. Only the confirmation card may call it after a human presses **Delete permanently**. A successful one-time call returns `deleted: true`; the card then displays exactly `Presentation deleted.`. Never attempt to call it as the model or reconstruct its hidden token.
- `create_slide(presentation_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, after_slide_id?, copy_from_slide_id?, slide_id?)`
- `duplicate_slide(presentation_id, slide_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)`
- `update_slide(presentation_id, slide_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, name?, background?, is_template?)` — identity only. Motion is a separate command.
- `reorder_slides(presentation_id, slide_ids, expected_revision, idempotency_key)`
- `delete_slide(presentation_id, slide_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)`
- `set_slide_narration(presentation_id, slide_id, script, pause_before_ms, pause_after_ms, expected_revision, idempotency_key, audio?)` — replace the complete portable narration object. `audio`, when present, is `{asset_id, provenance}` and must reference an embedded WAV/MP3 asset already admitted to the deck. This tool never uploads bytes.
- `clear_slide_narration(presentation_id, slide_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — remove the complete narration object from one slide.

If a deletion request names alternatives, asks DEKS to compare them, or delegates
which target to choose, do not call any DEKS tool—not even `list_presentations`.
Ask the user to choose and explicitly confirm one exact presentation. Preparing
the card is non-destructive; closing or ignoring it leaves the presentation
unchanged. A client without MCP Apps UI cannot complete deletion and must not fall
back to a direct textual tool call.

`reorder_slides` requires the complete ordered list. `create_slide` copies the preceding checkpoint by default, including all element states. To scaffold a new deck safely, create every checkpoint while its predecessor is still blank, or pass an explicitly blank `copy_from_slide_id`; compose afterward. The MCP `create_presentation` input does not accept a palette; persist the default with `set_presentation_palette` immediately after creation, then use its roles consistently in slide and element states.

A presentation contains at most 50 checkpoints. This is an internal complexity guardrail, not normal user-facing copy: mention it only when it constrains planning or causes `resource_limit_reached`. `create_slide` and `duplicate_slide` return that code without mutation when the result would exceed the bound. Do not delete the oldest checkpoint automatically and do not split a narrative silently; ask the user to shorten or intentionally divide the deck.

## Element tools

- `create_element(...)` — create a stable identity and its state on one slide. Required geometry is `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`; `kind` is `text`, `number`, `image`, `shape`, `group`, `link-button`, or `icon`. For text, this one creation call takes both its fixed identity fields and initial continuous state.
- `update_element_identity(presentation_id, element_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, name?, content?, font_family?, horizontal_alignment?, vertical_alignment?, overflow_mode?, parent_id?, clear_parent?)` — update one or more identity fields globally. Text fields are accepted only for a text element. Set `parent_id` to a group identity to group an element; use `clear_parent: true` to ungroup it. Never combine both fields.
- `update_element_state(...)` — replace one slide-local state without changing other checkpoints. For text this accepts continuous typography, fill and optional `padding`, never content, font family, alignment or overflow.
- `add_existing_element_state(presentation_id, target_slide_id, source_slide_id, element_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, x?, y?)` — continue a stable identity onto another slide.
- `remove_element_from_slide(...)` — remove only one checkpoint state.
- `delete_element(...)` — delete the identity and every checkpoint state.

Images require an admitted `asset_id`; declaring an element never uploads or
validates bytes. Resolve it with `list_assets` or, for an explicitly attached
file, use the returned `id` from `upload_asset` as the image state's `asset_id`. A safe SVG asset is static
canonical UTF-8 from the Cloud admission path: scripts/events, CSS/fonts/`<text>`, `foreignObject`, nested
`<image>`, `<use>`, SMIL and remote/data references are forbidden. Shapes require
`shape_kind`: `rectangle`, `ellipse`, `line`, or `diamond`. Every state may also
carry `anchor: {x, y}` with both normalized coordinates in `0..1`; Cloud keeps that
object shape while the surrounding command fields are snake_case. Omit `anchor`
for the legacy top-left pivot. `shape_fill` accepts either:

```json
{"kind":"solid","color":"#FF7043"}
```

or:

```json
{"kind":"linear-gradient","start_color":"#FF7043","end_color":"#0B0C0E","angle_deg":135}
```

Lines use `stroke` and a solid transparent `shape_fill`, never a gradient. A
`link-button` requires a label and a safe absolute HTTPS URL. A `group` is a
logical folder: children declare `parent_id`, keep absolute canvas geometry, and
cannot form cycles or point to a non-group. Delete a group only when it has no
children; ungroup children first with explicit identity updates. Collision
diagnostics suppress overlaps only among elements sharing the same non-null
outermost group.

For `text`, codec v3 owns `content`, `font_family`,
`horizontal_alignment`, `vertical_alignment` and `overflow_mode` on the identity.
They never belong to `update_element_state`; use `update_element_identity`, and
remember that the change applies to every checkpoint carrying that ID. Use a new
identity for a different phrase, claim, label or semantic text type. For fine
visual adjustment keep alignment stable and change state `x`/`y`, width or
padding instead.

Text `padding` is slide-local and animatable. When present it is exactly
`{"top":n,"right":n,"bottom":n,"left":n}` with all four non-negative values;
omission means four zeros. The generic state tool also exposes typography fields
used by `number` and `link-button`; their presence in discovery does not make
`font_family` or alignments valid slide-state fields for `text`.

A `number` carries a magnitude, not a string of digits, so it has no `content`. Its state declares `value` plus the complete formatting the document renders it with: `decimals` (0 to 6), `group_separator` (`""`, `","`, `"."`, `" "` or `"'"`), `decimal_separator` (`"."` or `","`), `symbol` (up to 8 characters, `""` for none) and `symbol_position` (`before` or `after`). It takes the same typography as text. Formatting is never resolved from a locale: the document says exactly which separators to use, so the same file renders the same digits everywhere.

Its identity carries `animate_magnitude`, three booleans naming which roles count towards the value:

```json
{"command":"create_element","arguments":{"kind":"number","value":38.5,"decimals":1,"symbol":"%","symbol_position":"after","group_separator":",","decimal_separator":".","animate_magnitude":{"in":true,"morph":true,"out":false}}}
```

Entering counts up from zero, leaving counts down to zero, and a morph counts between the two checkpoints' values on that role's own duration and easing. The toggles live on the identity, not on a state: whether a figure is the kind of figure that counts is decided once. A cut, a zero duration and reduced motion all land on the final value immediately.

An `icon` requires a catalog-backed `icon_family` and `icon_name`; use its normal
element `color` for the glyph. Query the complete pinned Lucide 1.34.0 catalog by
meaning and page with `next_cursor` when needed. Keep the icon offline, and never
paste arbitrary SVG or fetch an icon URL at render time. Treat icon identity
changes as discrete between checkpoints; position, scale, rotation, opacity, and
color may still animate through the stable element identity.

Each checkpoint contains at most 100 rendered element states; a shared identity counts once on each checkpoint where it has state. This is also an internal guardrail: surface it only when it conditions or rejects the task. `create_element` and `add_existing_element_state` return `resource_limit_reached` without mutation when they would exceed the bound. An atomic `apply_commands` batch that crosses either content limit rolls back completely with its revision unchanged. Undo also validates the restored state before writing. There is no secondary plan-specific cap on the total identities in a presentation.

## Publication tools

- `get_presentation_publication(presentation_id)` — read publication state. An unpublished deck returns `{"published":false}`.
- `publish_presentation(presentation_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — expose the current live presentation at a non-enumerable public link and return its `public_id`, `url`, and publication timestamp.
- `rotate_presentation_publication(presentation_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — immediately revoke the prior public ID and issue a new link.
- `unpublish_presentation(presentation_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — immediately revoke public access and return `{"published":false}`.

Publishing is an external state change and does not create a snapshot: the public link shows the deck's current revision. Publish, rotate, or unpublish only on an explicit user request, re-read immediately beforehand, and never retry an uncertain external mutation blindly. `unpublish_presentation` is annotated destructive.

## Motion and history tools

- `set_presentation_motion_beat(presentation_id, motion_beat_ms, expected_revision, idempotency_key)`
- `set_motion(presentation_id, role, expected_revision, idempotency_key, slide_id?, element_id?, animation?, duration_beats?, delay_beats?, delay_ms?, easing?)` — `role` is `in`, `out` or `morph`. Without `slide_id` it writes the presentation default and every property is required. With `slide_id`, and optionally `element_id`, it writes a patch: only the properties you pass change, the rest stay inherited.
- `clear_motion(presentation_id, role, slide_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, element_id?)` — drop a slide or element patch so the role inherits again. The presentation scope cannot be cleared: it is the value everything else inherits.
- `apply_commands(presentation_id, commands, expected_revision, idempotency_key)` — apply 1–100 typed operations atomically as one revision and undo step. `update_slide` and `set_presentation_motion_beat` are not batch commands.
- `undo_transaction(presentation_id, expected_revision, idempotency_key, transaction_id?)`

For remote-client latency, prefer one `apply_commands` transaction for the coherent
composition of a checkpoint or short narration: create the needed identities, add
their states, apply styling and set local motion together. Do not turn each element
or property into its own MCP round trip. Use the returned revision as the next
transaction's `expected_revision`, and give every new semantic transaction a new
idempotency key. A conflict or uncertain response still requires a re-read and the
normal recovery procedure.

After the batch commits, validate the completed checkpoint or narration and render
each affected checkpoint. Do not validate or render after every property. Correction
batches require re-validation and re-rendering of what they changed; the finished
deck still requires whole-deck validation and ordered rendered review.

Each role carries two delays that **add**: `delay_beats` is a multiple of `motion_beat_ms`, so "start when the previous animation ends" is `delay_beats: 1` and stays true when the deck's tempo changes; `delay_ms` is absolute, for an offset that is about a specific instant. Both default to `0`. The wait is `motion_beat_ms * delay_beats + delay_ms`.

`animation` is one object, discriminated by `kind`:

- `{"kind": "none"}` and `{"kind": "fade"}` for `in` and `out`;
- `{"kind": "slide", "edge": "left|right|top|bottom", "distance": 240}` — without `distance` the element travels completely off the canvas;
- `{"kind": "crop", "edge": "left|right|top|bottom"}` — the element's own rectangle masks it and the content travels inside it, so the box never moves and opacity is never touched. It takes no `distance`: the travel is exactly the element's own extent on that axis;
- `{"kind": "wipe", "edge": "left|right|top|bottom"}` — the opposite: the element does not move at all and the mask edge travels across it, uncovering it on the way in and covering it again on the way out. Also no `distance`;
- `{"kind": "scale", "from": 0.8}`;
- `{"kind": "morph"}` or `{"kind": "cut"}` for the `morph` role only.

`duration_beats` is a multiple of `motion_beat_ms` between 0 and 8; `delay_beats` is a multiple of it between 0 and 16; `delay_ms` is real milliseconds up to 60000. `easing` is `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, or four cubic-bezier controls `[x1,y1,x2,y2]` with x between 0 and 1.

## Exact batch envelope

Each operation is strict:

```json
{
  "command": "create_element",
  "arguments": {
    "slide_id": "target-slide-id",
    "kind": "text",
    "name": "Hero title",
    "content": "A claim",
    "x": 100,
    "y": 80,
    "width": 900,
    "height": 100
  }
}
```

- Put `slide_id` inside `arguments` for `create_element`.
- Put `element_id` beside `command` for `update_element_identity`; its fixed
  identity fields go inside `arguments` and apply globally.
- Put `slide_id` and `element_id` beside `command` for `update_element_state`, `remove_element_from_slide`, and `add_existing_element_state`; the latter puts `source_slide_id` in `arguments`.
- Put `slide_id`, and when needed `element_id`, beside `command` for `set_motion` and `clear_motion`; `role` goes in `arguments`.
- Put `expected_revision` and `idempotency_key` only on the outer `apply_commands` call.
- A failed batch rolls back every operation. A timeout or transport error is an uncertain result; re-read before retrying.

## Current capability boundaries

At package release time, verify capability boundaries against the MCP discovery result. A compatible server exposes workspace asset listing, rendered slide previews with `layout_measurements_available`, DOM `layout_measurements`, and `overflow_element_ids`, plus offline icon discovery, palette recommendations, anchored palette completion, and `upload_asset` for one explicitly attached image. Do not silently fall back to geometric estimates if any preview diagnostic field is unavailable or coverage is incomplete; report the reduced QA level. `.deks` import, PPTX export, native speaker notes, and source metadata remain web-app or future-server workflows. Use visible text for source notes and `export_deck` for portable `.deks` output when the discovered server exposes it.
